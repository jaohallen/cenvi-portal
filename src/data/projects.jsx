    description:
      "FireCheck is an urban fire hazard mapping project focused on residential areas in Metro Cebu. Using GIS analysis, fire hazard levels were computed, and machine learning models were developed to simulate fire spread. The project also trained stakeholders in neighborhood evacuation planning and investment planning to strengthen local fire prevention and response strategies. (2018–2020, 2023–2024)",
